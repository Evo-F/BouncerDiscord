## The official GitHub repository for Bouncer - a powerful tool for verifying new users in your Discord server!

To use Bouncer, simply invite it to your server and run /setup. Bouncer's convenient and efficient user interface will take it from there!

NOTE: For security reasons, you should run the /setup command within 24 hours of adding Bouncer to your server. If you fail to do this, the bot may remove itself from your server.
